    "#### 1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "`Solution: shutil. copy() will copy a single file, shutil. copytree() will copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it`\n",
    "#### 2. What function is used to rename files??\n",
    "`Solution: os.rename() function can be used to rename files or directories using a python program`\n",
    "#### 3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "`Solution: Shutil module provides a funciton called as shutil.rmtree() which deletes a directory and all its contents permanently. send2trash module provides a function called send2trash.send2trash() which moves the files/directories to trash folder instead of permanently deleting them.`\n",
    "#### 4. ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "`Solution:  ZipFile Module provides a method called as zipfile.ZipFile() to read and write to zipFiles.`\n",
    "#### 5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.\n",
